title: "Real-Time Teleoperation in Motion Mapping for Medical Robot Based on Robot Manipulator and Haptic Device"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-10-ROBIO-1
excerpt: "Access to specialized medical care, particularly in rural or underserved areas, remains a significant challenge, with limited availability of healthcare professionals and diagnostic equipment. Teleoperated robotic systems offer a solution by enabling remote procedures, such as ultrasound examinations, where doctors can operate robotic arms from distant locations. In response to these healthcare challenges, we propose a real-time teleoperation system for controlling a UR5 robot arm using a Geomagic Touch haptic device. This system maps the operator's hand movements to the robot arm, ensuring precise control and providing real-time haptic feedback, which is critical for delicate medical tasks. A force-torque sensor at the robot's end-effector measures the force applied during operation, relaying this information back to the haptic device to simulate tactile sensations. Synchronization between the devices at a frequency of 500 Hz ensures smooth and responsive control. Additionally, a Kalman filter is applied to reduce noise in the force data, enhancing system accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness with minimal delay and robust force feedback. This work represents a step forward in bridging the gap between remote healthcare providers and patients, offering a scalable solution for teleoperated medical procedures. All the codes and implementation details for this work can be found in the following repository: [https://github.com/primpunn/Master.git](https://github.com/primpunn/Master.git)."
