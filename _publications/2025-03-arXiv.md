title: "RoboDexVLM: Visual Language Model-Enabled Task Planning and Motion Control for Dexterous Robot Manipulation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-03-arXiv
excerpt: "This paper introduces RoboDexVLM, an innovative framework for robot task planning and grasp detection tailored for a collaborative manipulator equipped with a dexterous hand. Previous methods focus on simplified and limited manipulation tasks, which often neglect the complexities associated with grasping a diverse array of objects in a long-horizon manner. In contrast, our proposed framework utilizes a dexterous hand capable of grasping objects of varying shapes and sizes while executing tasks based on natural language commands. The proposed approach has the following core components: First, a robust task planner with a task-level recovery mechanism that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) is designed, which enables the system to interpret and execute open-vocabulary commands for long sequence tasks. Second, a language-guided dexterous grasp perception algorithm is presented based on robot kinematics and formal methods, tailored for zero-shot dexterous manipulation with diverse objects and commands. Comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of RoboDexVLM in handling long-horizon scenarios and performing dexterous grasping. These results highlight the framework's ability to operate in complex environments, showcasing its potential for open-vocabulary dexterous manipulation.
