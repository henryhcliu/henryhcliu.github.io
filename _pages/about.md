Welcome! I'm **Haichao Liu** (刘海超), currently a visiting scholar in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) (February 2025 - Present), where I am supervised by Prof. [Tong Heng Lee](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=dP8oLwYAAAAJ). 

Concurrently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the [Robot Motion Planning and Control Lab](https://personal.hkust-gz.edu.cn/junma) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (August 2022 - Present), under the guidance of Prof. [Jun Ma](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8VepsVAAAAAJ) and Prof. [Shaojie Shen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=u8Q0_xsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

Previously, I earned my Master's degree (August 2020 - July 2022) from the Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems and the [State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System](https://robot.hit.edu.cn/) at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/), where I was supervised by Prof. [Huijun Gao](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=2DdpHLEAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Weiyang Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BJ610OkAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I also participated in a Postgraduate Study Abroad Program at the School of Mathematics and Statistics at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) (August 2021 - January 2022). My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Robot Engineering from [Northeastern University](https://english.neu.edu.cn/) (2016 - 2020), within the [Faculty of Robot Science and Engineering](http://www.rse.neu.edu.cn/).

I am always open to discussions or potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me at <haichao.liu@connect.ust.hk>.
