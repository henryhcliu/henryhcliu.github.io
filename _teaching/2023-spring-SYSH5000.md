In this course, I take the TA duty for the course SYSH5000: Model-Based Systems Engineering. The course is designed for postgraduate students who are interested in learning the principles and practices of model-based systems engineering (MBSE). My duty is to assist the instructor, Prof. Ricky Shi-Wei LEE, in organizing group discussion, grading assignments, and providing feedback to students. I also help students to understand the course materials and solve their problems in the discussion session.
