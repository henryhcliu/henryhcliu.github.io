In this course, I take the TA duty for the course ROAS 5700: Robot Motion Planning and Control. The course is designed for postgraduate students who are interested in learning the principles and practices of robot motion planning and control. My duty is to assist the instructor, Prof. Jun MA, in grading assignments, conducting tutorial, and providing feedback to students. I also help students to understand the course materials and solve their problems in the tutorial session.
